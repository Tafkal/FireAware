NASA Space Apps Challenge 2018 Belgrade, Serbia. Team **.A.L.S.M.** code and hardware schematics

## Hardware
The hardware section is split into two parts, one of them being the code used, and the other the schematic of the hardware with other relevant information.

The code is written on the mbed online compiler, and for this git is exported to be build with the cmake-gcc-arm and a STM32 Nucleo-L476RG board.
